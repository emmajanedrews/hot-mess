Emma and Jamar provide your with their insight of the latest pop culture trends, current events, and daily activities from... you guessed it... smack dab in the middle of the United States. Omaha, mother fucking, Nebraska, bitches. They have overlapping personality traits, so they might agree on a topic, might not. Or they may get completely off track that you can't even follow their train of thought. Whatever, you're the one listening. But no, for real, this podcast is just for fun... although Emma and Jamar are not opposed to quitting their 9-5 jobs and doing this like, professionally. So if you know any sponsors who would be interested, send them this way. The main goal, though, of this podcast, is to solve world peace. Just trying to do our part.
